# IPL 2023 Analysis

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 season data, focusing on both univariate and bivariate analysis. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights regarding player performances, team performances, match outcomes, and more. The project includes visualizations and statistical analysis techniques to explore key aspects of the IPL 2023 season.

## Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- **Pandas**:  
  `import pandas as pd`  
  Used for data manipulation and analysis. It helps in handling large datasets and performing operations on DataFrames.

- **NumPy**:  
  `import numpy as np`  
  Used for numerical operations and handling arrays, performing statistical calculations, and working with data.

- **Matplotlib**:  
  `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`  
  Used for creating static visualizations, such as bar plots, line charts, and histograms.

- **Seaborn**:  
  `import seaborn as sns`  
  Built on top of Matplotlib, it is used for more sophisticated visualizations, including heatmaps and pair plots.

- **Plotly**:  
  `import plotly.graph_objs as go`  
  Used for interactive visualizations to provide a more dynamic and user-friendly experience.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/IPL_2023_analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd IPL_2023_analysis
   ```

3. Ensure your environment is set up with all dependencies.

   This will process the IPL 2023 dataset and generate the required univariate and bivariate analysis reports.

## Analysis Overview

### 1. Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis focuses on analyzing single variables individually. In this project, univariate analysis is performed on:

- **Player Performances**: Analyzing the distribution of runs, wickets, batting averages, strike rates, etc.
- **Team Performances**: Analyzing the total runs scored, wickets taken, and other team-level statistics.
- **Match Outcomes**: Analyzing match outcomes (win/loss) and other relevant factors such as the margin of victory.

Visualizations include:
- **Histograms** for run distributions, batting averages, etc.
- **Box plots** to visualize the spread of statistics.
- **Bar plots** to compare team performances.

### 2. Bivariate Analysis
Bivariate analysis explores relationships between two variables. In this project, bivariate analysis is performed to explore the following:

- **Runs vs. Strike Rate**: To understand how strike rate correlates with runs scored by batsmen.
- **Runs vs. Boundaries**: To check how the number of boundaries correlates with the total runs scored.
- **Wickets vs. Economy Rate**: To explore the relationship between wickets taken and the bowler's economy rate.

Visualizations include:
- **Scatter plots** to visualize the correlation between two variables.
- **Heatmaps** to explore correlations between multiple variables.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains IPL 2023 season data, including details such as:

- Player statistics (runs, wickets, batting average, strike rate, etc.)
- Team statistics (total runs scored, wickets taken, etc.)
- Match data (match date, teams, match result, etc.)

The dataset can be sourced from [source](link-to-dataset).
